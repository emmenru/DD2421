<h1>DD2421 LAB 3 - NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER + BOOSTING </h1>

<h2> Assignment 1 </h2>
Use the provided function, genBlobs(), that returns Gaussian distributed data points together with class labels, to generate some test data. Compute the ML-estimates for the data and plot the 95%-condence interval using the function plotGaussians.

<h2> Assignment 2 </h2>
Run testClassifier for the datasets and take note of the accuracies. Use plotBoundary
to plot the decision boundary of the 2D iris dataset.

<b>(1) When can a feature independence assumption be reasonable and when not?</b>

<b>(2) How does the decision boundary look for the Iris dataset? How could one improve
the classification results for this scenario by changing classifier or, alternatively,
manipulating the data?</b>
